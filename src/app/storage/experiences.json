I worked on different projects. \n \nThe first required to migrate a car fleet management tool written in .NET MVC 5 to PAAS, Azure App Services. We had to rewrite part of the application written to use a COM library in order to parse a Microsoft Excel file. \n \nThe second, in a team of 50 or more developers and using Angular and Ionic, required to swap the third party provider used by the home banking mobile app in order to categorise transactions made by the users. \n \nThe third focused on the maintenance of a WPF application operating in the Forex market. I integrated it with a new service performing credit checks on customers wanting to buy derivates.\n\nI took a legacy library that was parsing and running an SQL where clause and rewrote it/refitted to work with a novel internal framework.\n\nI took a legacy, data ingestion library that was subscribing to a stream of prices provided by Reuters, and rewrote/refitted to work with a novel internal framework; the Reuters feed at times was producing bursts of messages and I wrote a multi-threaded data-ingestor that was aggregating the prices returning the most updated values, pacing them using a configurable interval.\n\nI helped to deploy and to troubleshoot a background job that was loading in RAM GBs of data acting as a cache, keeping them in sync between their sources (a number of files on different shared folder published by other teams daily) and destinations (an Oracle DB). The job was exposing a Rest API that was querying the cache using .NET Web API, exposing OAuth 2.0 authentication (client credential flow) with JWT Tokens.\n\nMy daily tasks included attending meetings with customers, deliver the changes in time and handing over when moving to a different assignment.\n\nWhile at Avanade I managed become open source contributor on GitHub for the Microsoft Azure Event Hubs SDK. I also attended the the Microsoft Build 2020 event, I was rewarded with an exam voucher, I used it to pass my AZ204: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure exam. Avanade generously provides weeks of training for their employees and pays their exams. By winning the voucher I saved the company the cost of the exam.",

We iteratively moved from front-end to back-end pagination, reducing the ability for the user to work offline.              \n\nNotable contributions:              \n- Passed Microsoft AZ-400 Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions certification       \n- Together with AZ-204 became 'DevOps Engineer Expert'       \n- Passed the Problem Solver Intermediate certification on HackerRank       \n- Spotted and reproduced XSS vulnerability during PR before it reached release introduced by this dependency https://github.com/peternewnham/react-html-parser/blob/master/README.md#security       \n- Suggested how PostJsonAsync could help save memory by sending data directly on the wire        \n- Implemented a custom React Numerical Input starting from repo https://github.com/mohitgupta8888/react-currency-format/blob/react-currency-format/src/currency-format.js       \n- During a PR, suggested how using DB pagination could avoid loading data in memory",
